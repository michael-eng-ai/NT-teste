Monitoring Strategy for ETL Pipeline and Databricks

1. Key Metrics for Monitoring

1.1. Pipeline Execution Time

	•	Objective: Monitor the total execution time of the ETL pipeline to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
	•	Details:
	•	Track the start and end times of the pipeline.
	•	Calculate and log the duration of each ETL job.
	•	Set thresholds for acceptable execution times and generate alerts if these thresholds are exceeded.

1.2. Number of Records Processed

	•	Objective: Ensure that all expected data is processed by monitoring the number of records processed in each stage of the ETL pipeline.
	•	Details:
	•	Log the number of records ingested from the source.
	•	Monitor the number of records after each transformation step.
	•	Verify the number of records loaded into Databricks to ensure data completeness.

1.3. Errors and Failures

	•	Objective: Capture and monitor errors or failures that occur during the ETL process to prevent data loss or corruption.
	•	Details:
	•	Implement error handling to log any exceptions or failures during the ETL process.
	•	Monitor for common issues such as connection timeouts, data format mismatches, or transformation errors.
	•	Set up alerts to notify the team immediately if critical errors occur.

1.4. Performance of Queries in Databricks

	•	Objective: Monitor the performance of queries executed in Databricks to ensure efficient data access and processing.
	•	Details:
	•	Track the execution time of key queries in Databricks.
	•	Monitor the resource usage (CPU, memory) of the Databricks cluster during query execution.
	•	Identify and optimize slow-running queries to improve overall performance.

2. Monitoring Tools

2.1. Databricks Jobs UI

	•	Objective: Utilize Databricks Jobs UI to monitor the status of ETL jobs, view logs, and manage job schedules.
	•	Details:
	•	Use the Jobs UI to monitor the progress of ongoing jobs and check the status of past job runs.
	•	Access detailed logs to debug issues and review the performance of each job step.
	•	Configure job notifications to alert the team when jobs succeed or fail.

2.2. Prometheus and Grafana

	•	Objective: Integrate Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for real-time monitoring dashboards.
	•	Details:
	•	Set up Prometheus to collect metrics such as pipeline execution time, number of records processed, and error counts.
	•	Use Grafana to visualize these metrics and create dashboards that provide an overview of the pipeline’s health.
	•	Configure Grafana alerts to notify the team when metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

2.3. Logs and Alerts

	•	Objective: Implement detailed logging and alerting to ensure quick response to critical issues.
	•	Details:
	•	Set up logging at various stages of the pipeline to capture detailed information about data processing.
	•	Use logging frameworks like Log4j or Python’s built-in logging module to format and store logs.
	•	Configure alerts via email, Slack, or other messaging systems to notify the team of critical issues.

3. Incident Response

3.1. Recovery Strategy

	•	Objective: Define procedures to recover from failures or data issues in the ETL pipeline.
	•	Details:
	•	Implement reprocessing logic to handle failed jobs, such as retry mechanisms or manual re-execution.
	•	Ensure that data integrity checks are in place to validate the correctness of reprocessed data.
	•	Document steps for recovering from common issues, such as data source unavailability or processing errors.

3.2. Alerts and Notifications

	•	Objective: Ensure that the team is promptly notified of any critical issues in the ETL pipeline or Databricks environment.
	•	Details:
	•	Set up alerts for critical metrics such as job failures, significant drops in record counts, or query performance degradation.
	•	Use Databricks’ built-in notification system or integrate with external services like PagerDuty or OpsGenie for incident management.
	•	Ensure that alerts include actionable information to guide the team in resolving issues quickly.

3.3. Incident Documentation

	•	Objective: Maintain a record of incidents and the actions taken to resolve them for continuous improvement.
	•	Details:
	•	Document each incident, including the root cause, steps taken to resolve the issue, and any follow-up actions.
	•	Use this documentation to identify patterns in recurring issues and implement preventive measures.
	•	Share incident reports with relevant stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.
