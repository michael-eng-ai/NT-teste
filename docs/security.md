Security Measures for ETL Pipeline and Databricks

1. Security During the ETL Process

1.1. Authentication and Authorization

	•	Secure Authentication:
	•	Utilize OAuth or API keys for secure authentication when accessing data sources and the Databricks platform.
	•	Ensure that access to the ETL pipeline is restricted to authorized users and services only.
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
	•	Implement RBAC in the ETL pipeline to manage access rights, ensuring that users have access only to the data and operations necessary for their roles.

1.2. Data Encryption in Transit

	•	Use HTTPS:
	•	Ensure that all data transmitted between the data source and Databricks is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
	•	Encryption of Sensitive Data:
	•	Encrypt all sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), before transmitting it to the Databricks platform.

1.3. Secure Credential Management

	•	Use Databricks Secrets:
	•	Store sensitive credentials, such as database passwords and API keys, using Databricks Secrets to prevent them from being exposed in the codebase.
	•	Access these credentials securely within notebooks and ETL scripts, minimizing the risk of accidental exposure.
	•	Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:
	•	Avoid storing credentials directly in the codebase. Instead, use environment variables or secret management tools like Databricks Secrets.

2. Security of Data Stored in Databricks

2.1. Data Encryption at Rest

	•	AES-256 Encryption:
	•	Implement AES-256 encryption for all data stored in Databricks, ensuring that sensitive information is protected even if the storage media is compromised.
	•	Secure Storage Solutions:
	•	Use Databricks’ built-in security features to manage encryption keys and ensure that data at rest is stored securely.

2.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

	•	Granular Access Control:
	•	Define granular permissions for reading, writing, and administering datasets within Databricks.
	•	Implement RBAC to ensure that users can only access data that is relevant to their roles.
	•	Audit and Compliance:
	•	Regularly review and update access controls to comply with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements.

2.3. Monitoring and Auditing

	•	Audit Logs:
	•	Enable audit logging to track access to datasets and ETL processes within Databricks.
	•	Logs should include details such as who accessed the data, what actions were performed, and when they occurred.
	•	Intrusion Detection:
	•	Use monitoring tools to detect unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.
	•	Implement alerts for any anomalous activities, such as access from unexpected locations or unusual data processing patterns.
	•	Regular Security Reviews:
	•	Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the ETL pipeline and data storage.
